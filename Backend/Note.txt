#Why keep SecurityConfig and EmailConfig in separate folders?
Separation of Concerns (SoC)
Keeping each config in its own package promotes modularity. Security logic and email settings are unrelated, so they should not be bundled together.

Improved Readability
When your application grows, it’s easier for new developers to find and understand the purpose of each configuration.

Easier Testing and Debugging
Having separate modules makes unit testing and debugging more manageable.

Better Maintainability
Changes in one config (e.g., updating security filters) won’t affect other unrelated configs (e.g., SMTP settings).

Scalability
As your SaaS grows, you might have more config files (e.g., PaymentConfig, DatabaseConfig, etc.). Separate folders help manage complexity.
